# "Play faster."
You'll often hear this advice given to players who find themselves in a rut, chasing an elusive promotion. Those offering speed as a solution will often point out, "Look at how fast Grand Champion players are." And they say this because it makes a great deal of sense. You can even find data from [calculated.gg](http://calculated.gg/) that could support this point of view.

Restating things more technically, speed and player rank have a **0.96** correlation. Given that the scale tops out at 1.0, that correlation is massive in the world of statistics. Faster play equals higher rank. And as even stronger data, shooting percentage has a **-0.97** correlation. Meaning you could even more confidently conclude that as players gain rank they become worse shooters.  

Except that's ridiculous. We all know players are much better shooters as you climb the ladder. It just so happens that as you ascend the number of made saves rises even more quickly than the number of shots placed on net. Shot accuracy actually rises dramatically. 

Correlation from one metric isn't telling even close to the whole story. Such a narrow focus leads to absurdity. We need to broaden our view.

Variance plays a huge role in telling the story of any data. When we look back at our distributions of player average speeds we can see that there is a non-trivial amount of overlap between the lowly Silver 1 population and the Grand Champions(*1580 average MMR*). Interestingly, the overlap occurs such that around 1/6th of the players in Silver 1 are playing at average speeds *faster* than about 1/4th of Grand Champions. Put another way, you should expect the fastest **Silver** in a 3v3 lobby to be **playing faster than the slowest Grand Champion** in a 2v2 match a staggering **71% of the time**.

Clearly, `faster =/= better`.

# What's really going on then?
We're far better off asking questions with more nuance if we want to understand what this correlation between speed and rank is hinting at. That correlation lets us know that higher ranked players are moving more quickly on average, but looking at a broader scope of variables will help us understand **how** they do it.

Taking a look at this graph we see Gold 1 is the rank where players spend the lowest proportion of their time moving at speeds throttle alone can't reach. Conversely, Grand Champions spend more than half of their time traveling at speeds that require using wavedashes, dodges or just good-old-fashioned boost. It's unsurprising then that they consistently have the *lowest* average boost level. Even though they consistently collect the *highest* number of small boost pads as they move, they use it just as quickly as they pick it up. Efficiently cruising and collecting in massive quantities like a baleen whale at lunch time.

But boost has more than one use. As it turns out, minimizing the amount of time you're moving slowly is even more highly correlated with rank than raw speed. A whopping **0.98**. While GCs glide along at high speeds, occasionally boosting to make the leap to supersonic, they often use that boost to recover after those inevitable moments where we all end up slowing down. 

While most us us appreciate the value of positioning, it can be easily lost on us how valuable acceleration is. Accelerating quickly after these necessary periods of crawling along has an **exponential** effect on positioning. I'm saying that literally. And it is at low speeds where boosting will bestow you the greatest advantage, though I'll leave the Physics equations as proof for another day.

If anything, "drive faster" would be better off replaced with, "drive very slowly less often".

Seeing that the higher ranked a player is the faster he or she is likely to be driving shouldn't at all suggest to us that the key to ranking up is something that starts with "drive faster". Driving quickly is great, but speed is a symptom of success. It's not the cause. As we know, leaving out key factors can lead to some absurd conclusions.

### Some food for thought

I know that many people who've read this far are thinking, "David, 'play faster' isn't meant literally. It's about decisiveness. Do whatever you're going to do, but do it quickly."

But rarely do you hear, "be decisive". I digress.

If that's the case, that sacrificing the quality of your decisions for the speed you enact them is the path to success, then our data should support it. If it's better to leap without looking then on average we should expect GCs to spend more time on the offense, forsaking the option to fall back and continue considering your options like those Platinum-tier small-brains.

The data *does* show GCs spend the most time in the attacking third!

But they do so by a slim and nearly meaningless margin. It turns out this game is complicated, and maybe extremely basic advice is not only useless but detrimental.

# So what is my advice if not "play faster"?

Ranking up in Rocket League is difficult. More than anything, I believe recognizing Soccar as a complex and intricate sport is a first step toward developing a successful playstyle. With all of the possibilities to consider, I have to strongly caution against any strategy as simplistic as turning your brain off and charging in. What should you do instead? **Think more. Slowly.**

### Replay Analysis

For anyone who doesn't watch their game-replays back, you'll be blown away at how many times you'll spot yourself doing something in the heat of the moment where you'll say, "What was I thinking?" Finding a handful of glaring mistakes you can start to correct is going to be much more useful than vaguely attempting to speed up. 

Analyzing your replays provides you the time to reflect and consider your options in a way that a professional player could probably do in milliseconds. That's fine. These players have honed their abilities to make pro-level decisions quickly. The rest of us don't have that power(yet). Your superpower is not being confined by the dictates of a ticking in-game clock. Without that constraint you're capable of coaching yourself to greatness. Drive faster and think less? No thanks, I'll drive smarter and think differently. 

"Play faster" isn't entirely without merit, and its proponents aren't fools. But it's crap advice.
