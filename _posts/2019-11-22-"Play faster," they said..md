# "Play faster."
You'll often hear this advice given to players who find themselves in a rut, heading out to seek answers as to why that next promotion is so elusive. Those offering speed as a solution will often point out, "Look at how fast Grand Champion players are." And they say this because it makes a great deal of sense. And we'll be looking at some data from [calculated.gg](http://calculated.gg/) that supports this point of view.

Restating things more technically, speed and player rank have a **0.96** correlation. That's massive in the world of statistics. Faster play equals higher rank. But then again, shooting percentage has a **-0.97** correlation. Meaning you could even more confidently conclude that as players gain rank they become worse shooters.  

Except that's ridiculous. We all know players are much better shooters as you climb the ladder. It just so happens the number of saves  made rises even more quickly than the number of shots on net as you ascend. Shot accuracy actually rises dramatically. Correlation from one metric doesn't tell even close to the whole story. A narrow focus leads to absurdity.

Variance plays a huge role in telling the story of any data. When we look back at our distributions of player average speeds we can see that there is a non-trivial amount of overlap between the lowly Silver 1 population and the Grand Champions(*1580 average MMR*). Interestingly, the overlap occurs such that 1/6th of the players in Silver 1 are playing at average speeds faster than 1/4 of Grand Champions. Put another way, the fastest Silver in a 3v3 lobby has fantastic odds of being faster than the slowest Grand Champion in a 2v2 match. In 10,000 sample calculations it was a higher than 71% chance.

Clearly, `faster =/= better`.

# What's really going on then?
We're far better off asking questions with more nuance if we want to understand what this correlation between speed and rank is hinting at. That correlation lets us know that higher ranked players are moving more quickly on average, but other data will show us how.

Taking a look at this graph we see Gold 1 is the rank where players spend the lowest proportion of their time in a match moving at speeds that throttle alone can't reach. On the other end of the spectrum, Grand Champions spend more than half of their time using wavedashes, dodges or good-old-fashioned boost to travel. It's unsurprising then that they consistently have the *lowest* average boost level, even though they consistently collect the *highest* number of small boost pads as they move. They use it up as quickly as they pick it up, efficiently cruising and collecting like a baleen whale.

Plus, boost has more than one use. While GCs glide along at high speeds, they also using that boost to accelerate after those moments where we all inevitably must slow down. Some of us recovering momentum more slowly than others.

Seeing that the higher ranked a player is the faster he or she is likely to be driving shouldn't at all suggest to us that the key to ranking up is something that starts with "drive faster". Driving quickly is great, but speed is a symptom of success. It's not the cause. As we know, leaving out key factors can lead to some absurd conclusions.

# Some food for thought

I know that many people who've read this far are thinking, "David, 'play faster' isn't meant literally. It's about decisiveness. Do whatever you're going to do, but do it quickly."

If that's the case, that sacrificing the quality of your decisions for the speed you enact them is the path to success, then our data should support it. If it's better to leap without looking then we should expect GCs to spend more time on the offense, forsaking the option to fall back and continue considering your options like those Platinum-tier small-brains.

The data *does* show GCs spend the most time in the attacking third!

But they do so by a slim and nearly meaningless margin. It turns out this game is complicated.

### So what is my advice if not "play faster"?

More than anything, I believe recognizing Soccar as a complex and intricate sport is a first step toward a successful playstyle. With all of the possibilities to consider, I have to strongly caution against any strategy as simplistic as turning your brain off and charging in. What should you do instead? **Think more. Slowly.**

For anyone who doesn't watch their game-replays back, you'll be blown away at how many times you'll spot yourself doing something in the heat of the moment where you'll say, "What was I thinking?" Finding a handful of glaring mistakes you can start to correct is going to be much more useful than vaguely attempting to speed up. Analyzing your replays provides you the time to reflect and consider your options in a way that sure, a professional player could probably do in milliseconds. An incredible superpower to make pro-level decisions that quickly. The rest of us don't have that(yet). That's fine. Your superpower is not being confined to a ticking clock. Drive faster and think less? No thanks, I'll drive smarter and think differently. 

"Play faster" isn't entirely without merit, and its proponents aren't fools. But it's crap advice.
